title: "GRÃ“-FTP ARAM - Population Models"
---

## Prerequisites

For this part of the GRO-FTP ARAM line, you are expected to already have some fluency in using Rstudio and tidyverse. At this point you should also start thinking of how you plan to organize your files and work into a project, or even start using Rmarkdown files to take notes and do exploratory studies and plots.

## Schedule

The population dynamics section of teaching is split into roughly 8 half-day sessions:

[Simple population models](Simple_population_models.qmd)

[Review-what are models?](Review-what%20are%20models.qmd)

[Fitting a logistic growth curve](Fitting_logistic_curve.qmd)

[Surplus production models](Surplus_production_models.qmd)
